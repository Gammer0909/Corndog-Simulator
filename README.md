# Corndog-Simulator
A crappy indie game that I made, you can download it here: https://the-game12345.itch.io/corndog-simulator


If you are interested in this project (#1: Why?) then it is a clicker game that I made and plan on updating, 
at least until I get bored or I finally learn how to 3D model. It is written in C#, if you have any issues go to the Issues page, I can help you there.
